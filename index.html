                <p>
                    After graduating from Texas State University with a degree in Anthropology I became very familiar with what I call "The Great Nothing" or "Post-grad Purgatory". With no school to focus on and very limited job options my life became a blur of hamburger grease cut by moments of clarity in which I would hear the voices of my ancestors warning me about a Liberal Arts degree. I worked for a brief period as an Archaeologist, but I quickly realized that the lifestyle was not for me. While I loved the subject in school, the real world application of those skills as well as spending more time in hotels than at home was not my cup of tea. I returned to the grease dungeon to which I am forever bound to continue working as a cook while I reevaluated my life for awhile. After sitting on a few potential ideas I started dabbling in learning code though various websites. After a few weeks of that I decided to jump off the deep end and sign up for this bootcamp.
                    <br> As for my personal life, I'm an avid gamer. Whether it be video games, tabletop, or card games I'm into it. I love reading; my current preference is graphic novels, and I'm a big fan of cartoons. I'm a pretty solid cook, and I spend alot of free time trying new things in the kitchen at home. I balance out being an "indoor kid" by weight lifting. When I had more time post-graduation I spent a year training hard with hopes to compete in power lifting competitions, but life picked up again and I started focusing more on other things. I still love doing so, but these days it's more about mental health than goal oriented training. Nothing destresses you quite like weight lifting. Alas, this isn't a dating profile so I'll stop there. If you want to know more you can click on my "Connect with me" links and be seriously underwhelmed by how little there is on those pages.
